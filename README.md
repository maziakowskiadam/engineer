This is a project for my engineering thesis. It's an application that helps with hospital appointments and patient registration.

It has been divided into 3 main parts:
* IdentityService - C# library responsible for authentication and authorization.
* database-service - Spring REST API
* mcc-app - Angular 8 front end that binds all parts together
